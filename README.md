# Probabilistic.py

Probabilistic is a Python library designed to facilitate the probabilistic execution of functions and the analysis of their outcome distributions. Whether you're simulating uncertain events, performing randomized experiments, or adding an element of chance to your applications, Probabilistic provides a straightforward and flexible toolkit to meet your needs.

## Installation

You can install the **Probabilistic** library using `pip`. Ensure that you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

```bash
pip install probabilistic.py
```

## Quick Start

Here's a quick example to get you started with Probabilistic.

```python
import probabilistic

def hello():
    print("Hello!")

# Create a probabilistic function with a 50% execution probability
maybe_hello = probabilistic.function(func=hello, p=0.5)

# Execute the probabilistic function
maybe_hello()
```
